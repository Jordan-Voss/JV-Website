        <h2>Barbell and Body Tracker</h2>
        <img src="images/banner.jpeg">
        </a>
        <p>This project focuses on tracking the movement of a barbell and body parts
             during weightlifting exercises using image processing techniques. By analyzing
              video recordings, the system identifies the barbell and key body parts, 
              then calculates the barbell's velocity, path, and provides form improvement 
              tips to help prevent injuries.</p>
        <p>The tech stack includes the Flask framework for ui with python backend and postgres database with OpenCV used for image processing and tracking bodyparts.
